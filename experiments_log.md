## Test on 20 second in ATC

full-v8-20-k-gt-sigma0.2 and full-v8-20-k-mod-sigma0.2


full-v8-20-k-gt and full-v8-20-k-mod

Add sigma achiever lower avg-ADE than non-sigma one.






## Not sure:
1. evaluation metrics: 
    - min ADE, FDE. or avg ADE, FDE, or most-like ADE, FDE
2. method: what loss should use, 
3. which prediction horizon we should use, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60?




## TODO:
1. Finish the current method for ATC dataset as soon as possible. Not need to be perfect. But with a number. And qualitative examples. 目标明确，试验几个组合，然后快速出结果。 Feb 27. Feb 28. Mar 01
2. Baselines:
    - Baselines for ATC dataset. Feb 28. Mar 01. Mar 02.
3. Another dataset:
    - Look into NBA dataset. Run experiments. Mar 02. Mar 03. Mar 04.

## Writing:
1. write Method section Feb 27th. Feb 28.
2. write Related work section Mar 01.
3. write Experiment section Mar 02. Mar 03.
4. write Results section Mar 03. Mar 04.
5. write Introduction section Mar 04. Mar 05.
6. write Conclusion section Mar 04. Mar 05.
